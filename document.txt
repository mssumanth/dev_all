This script is designed to generate end-to-end documentation based on a given code file. 
It uses the Solar AI model from the Upstage API to analyze the code, answer questions related to 
it, and generate documentation. 
The script reads a file, chunks the content into smaller segments, 
and then asks Solar AI questions about the code using these segments. 
The responses are checked for groundedness and the appropriate response is returned. 
The final documentation is then saved into a file called documentation.txt.The code provided is an example of how to use the Solar API, a conversational AI model provided by Upstage. The Solar API can be used to generate text based on a given context and a question. The code also includes functions for analyzing the layout of a PDF file, chunking text into smaller segments, and processing HTML content using BeautifulSoup. The code also uses the openai library to interact with the OpenAI API.

To generate the complete end-to-end documentation, the code reads the entire code present in the `run.py` file and passes it as context to the Solar API to generate the documentation.

The code also includes a function called `api_chain()` which is used to generate the complete end-to-end python based code to make an API call to Chat Completions API of Together.AI, the function `api_chain()` calls the function `chunked_api_call()` to generate the python code, then it reads the generated python code from the file `generated.py` and use it as context to call the function `api_call()` to generate the final python code and write it to the same file `generated.py`.

It also includes a function called `generate_documentation()` which is used to generate the documentation from the context present in the `run.py` file by calling the `api_call()` function with the `doc_prompt` as context and writing the generated documentation to the file `documentation.txt`.

It's worth noting that the code uses the `OpenAI()` class to interact with the OpenAI API, it also uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the Solar API and the `bs4` library to parse HTML content. It also uses the `json` library to work with JSON data, the `os` library to interact with the operating system, and the `urllib.parse` library to manipulate URLs.Documentation.txt
================

This Python script is designed to interact with various APIs using OpenAI's Solar model to generate code and documentation. The script mainly consists of two main functions: `api_call` and `chunked_api_call`. These functions take in a context and a question as input and use the Solar model to generate an answer to the question based on the given context.

The script starts by importing necessary libraries and reading the API keys from a configuration file called `config.cfg`. It then initializes an OpenAI client with the provided API key.

The `analyze_layout` function is responsible for analyzing the layout of a given PDF file and returning its HTML representation. The `process_html_content` function is responsible for processing the HTML content by extracting specific elements, such as paragraphs.

The `read_file` function reads the content of a file and returns it as a string. This function is used to read the HTML content of the API documentation files.

The `ask_solar` function sends a request to the Solar model to generate an answer to the given question based on the provided context. The `check_groundedness` function checks whether the generated answer is grounded or not, i.e., whether it is relevant to the context.

The `chunk_text` function breaks the context into smaller chunks of a specified size to enable parallel processing.

The `api_call` function is used to make a single API call to the Solar model with the entire context. The `chunked_api_call` function, on the other hand, breaks the context into smaller chunks and makes multiple API calls to the Solar model in parallel to generate an answer to the question.

The `api_chain` function is the main function that orchestrates the entire process. It first generates code for a specific user prompt using `chunked_api_call`, appends the generated code to a file called `generated.py`, and then reads the code from the file to generate step-by-step documentation. Finally, it overwrites the `generated.py` file with the final code.

The `generate_documentation` function is responsible for generating documentation based on the code in the script. It reads the script's content and sends it to the Solar model along with a prompt to generate documentation. The generated documentation is then appended to a file called `documentation.txt`.

Overall, this script provides a flexible and efficient way to interact with various APIs and generate code and documentation using OpenAI's Solar model.The following is a high-level overview of the code in this file:

This script consists of several functions that are used to process and analyze HTML content using the Document AI API and generate responses to user questions using the Solar chatbot API. The first step is to read a file containing HTML content and then chunk it into smaller segments using the `chunk_text` function. The `process_html_content` function is used to extract and print the text from all paragraph elements in the HTML content.

The `analyze_layout` function is used to analyze the layout of a document and return its HTML representation. The `ask_solar` function is used to ask the Solar chatbot a question and receive a response. The `check_groundedness` function is used to verify whether a given answer is grounded in the context provided.

The `chunked_api_call` function is used to call the Solar chatbot API with a chunk of the HTML content and the user question, and check if the answer is grounded. If it is, the answer is returned. If not, the next chunk of the HTML content is used to ask the question again until a grounded answer is found or all chunks have been processed.

The `api_call` function is similar to `chunked_api_call` but instead of processing the HTML content in chunks, it processes the entire context at once.

The `create_and_append_to_file` and `overwrite_a_file` functions are used to write the generated code to a file.

The `api_chain` function is a chain of functions that are used to generate the complete code to make an API call to the Chat Completions API of Together. The `generate_documentation` function is used to generate the documentation for the code in this file.The given code is a Python script that utilizes the OpenAI API to analyze and process HTML content.

The script starts by importing necessary libraries and reading the configuration file 'config.cfg' to obtain the API keys for 'Document AI' and 'Solar'.

The `analyze_layout` function takes a file name as input, sends a POST request to the Document AI API with the file as a parameter, and returns the JSON response containing the HTML content of the file.

The `ask_solar` function takes a context and a question as input, sends a POST request to the Solar API with the context and question as parameters, and returns the response from the API.

The `check_groundedness` function takes a context, question, and answer as input, sends a POST request to the Solar API with the context, question, and answer as parameters, and returns whether the answer is grounded or not based on the response from the API.

The `chunk_text` function takes a text and a chunk size as input and returns a list of smaller segments of the text based on the chunk size.

The `process_html_content` function takes HTML content as input, processes it using BeautifulSoup, and prints the extracted text.

The `read_file` function takes a file path as input and reads the content of the file.

The `chunked_api_call` function takes a question as input, sends multiple requests to the Solar API with the question and each chunk of the context as parameters, and returns the answer from the API if it is grounded.

The `api_call` function takes a context and a question as input, sends multiple requests to the Solar API with the context and question as parameters, and returns the answer from the API if it is grounded.

The `create_and_append_to_file` function takes content and an output file name as input and appends the content to the file.

The `overwrite_a_file` function takes content and an output file name as input and overwrites the content of the file.

The `api_chain` function sends a request to the Solar API to generate Python code to make an API call to Chat Completions API of Together. It then sends another request to the Solar API to rectify the generated code.

The `generate_documentation` function sends a request to the Solar API to generate documentation based on the code in the script. The generated documentation is then printed and appended to a file named 'documentation.txt'.This Python script utilizes several external libraries to create an AI-based chatbot system. Here's a high-level overview of its functionalities:

1. **Configuration**: The script starts by reading the API keys and other configurations from a config file named 'config.cfg'. These configurations are used to connect to external APIs.

2. **Document Analysis**: The `analyze_layout` function is used to analyze the layout of a document. This function takes a document file as input, sends a request to an external API (using the provided API key) to analyze the layout of the document, and returns the HTML representation of the layout.

3. **Chatbot Interaction**: The script uses the Solar AI API to implement a chatbot. The `ask_solar` function takes a context and a question as inputs, sends a request to the Solar AI API to get an answer to the question based on the provided context, and returns the answer.

4. **Answer Verification**: The `check_groundedness` function takes a context, a question, and an answer as inputs. It sends a request to the Solar AI API to verify if the provided answer is grounded in the given context, and returns a boolean value indicating the result.

5. **Text Chunking**: The `chunk_text` function is used to split a large text into smaller, manageable chunks based on a specified chunk size.

6. **HTML Processing**: The `process_html_content` function uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse and process HTML content.

7. **File Reading**: The `read_file` function reads the content of a file and returns it as a string.

8. **API Calls**: The script contains two functions, `chunked_api_call` and `api_call`, that interact with the Solar AI API to get answers to questions based on the provided context. The `api_call` function uses the entire context for the question, while the `chunked_api_call` function splits the context into smaller chunks and queries the API for each chunk.

9. **Code Generation and Rectification**: The `api_chain` function is responsible for generating and rectifying code. It first uses the `chunked_api_call` function to generate code, then uses the `api_call` function to rectify and finalize the code. The final code is saved in a file named 'generated.py'.

10. **Documentation Generation**: The `generate_documentation` function is used to generate documentation based on the code in the script. It uses the `api_call` function to get the documentation and saves it in a file named 'documentation.txt'.

This script is designed to work with the Solar AI API and Document AI API provided by Upstage.AI. The API keys and base URLs for these services are stored in the 'config.cfg' file.The `generate_documentation()` function reads the content of the `run.py` file and passes it as context to the `api_call()` function, along with a prompt asking for the generation of end-to-end documentation on a high level based on the code in the `run.py` file. The `api_call()` function uses this context and prompt to generate the documentation, which is then printed and appended to a file called `document.txt`.

The generated documentation likely contains a high-level description of the code in the `run.py` file, including an explanation of the various functions and how they are used to perform API calls to the Together.AI ChatCompletions API. The documentation may also include information on how the code processes HTML content, reads files, and checks the groundedness of answers provided by the API.Documentation for the high-level end-to-end code in the file:

This code is designed to work with the Together.AI API, specifically the Chat Completions API. It utilizes the OpenAI library to make API calls to the Together.AI API.

The code begins by importing necessary libraries and reading the configuration file 'config.cfg' using the configparser module. It then extracts the API keys for the Document AI (docai_api_key) and the Solar API (solar_api_key) from the configuration file.

The code then creates an instance of the OpenAI client, passing in the Solar API key and the base URL for the Together.AI API.

There are several functions defined in the code, which can be summarized as follows:

* analyze\_layout(filename): This function takes a filename as input and sends a POST request to the Document AI layout analyzer API with the specified filename. It returns the HTML content of the analyzed document.
* ask\_solar(context, question): This function takes a context string and a question, and sends a POST request to the Solar API's chat completions endpoint with the provided context and question. It returns the response from the Solar API.
* check\_groundedness(context, question, answer): This function takes a context string, a question, and an answer, and sends a POST request to the Solar API's answer verification endpoint with the provided context, question, and answer. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the answer is grounded in the context.
* chunk\_text(text, chunk\_size): This function takes a string and a chunk size as input, and splits the string into smaller chunks of the specified size.
* process\_html\_content(html\_content): This function takes an HTML content string as input and uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML. It can be used to extract information from the HTML content.
* read\_file(file\_path): This function takes a file path as input and reads the entire content of the file.
* chunked\_api\_call(question): This function takes a question as input, and iteratively sends the question to the Solar API's chat completions endpoint, along with chunks of the context string. It checks whether the answer is grounded in the context, and returns the first grounded answer it receives.
* api\_call(context, question): This function takes a context string and a question as input, and iteratively sends the question to the Solar API's chat completions endpoint with the provided context. It checks whether the answer is grounded in the context, and returns the first grounded answer it receives.
* create\_and\_append\_to\_file(content, out\_file): This function takes a content string and an output file path as input, and appends the content to the end of the output file.
* overwrite\_a\_file(content, out\_file): This function takes a content string and an output file path as input, and overwrites the entire contents of the output file with the provided content.

The code then defines a function called api\_chain(), which generates a code snippet using the chunked\_api\_call() function and appends it to a file called 'generated.py'. It then reads the contents of the 'generated.py' file, and sends a question to the Solar API's chat completions endpoint asking it to check the generated code and correct it if necessary. The resulting code is then overwritten in the 'generated.py' file.

Finally, the code defines a function called generate\_documentation(), which reads the contents of the 'run.py' file and sends a question to the Solar API's chat completions endpoint asking it to generate high-level documentation for the code in the file. The resulting documentation is then printed to the console and appended to a file called 'documentation.txt'.The script is a Python program that uses several libraries to perform a series of tasks. It starts by importing the necessary libraries and then reads a configuration file called 'config.cfg' using the ConfigParser module. The configuration file contains API keys for two different services: 'docai_api_key' and 'solar_api_key'.

The script then creates an instance of the OpenAI client using the 'solar_api_key' and sets the base URL to the 'upstage.ai' API endpoint.

The script defines three functions: analyze\_layout(), ask\_solar(), and check\_groundedness(). The function analyze\_layout() takes a file name as input and sends a POST request to the 'upstage.ai' API endpoint with the file as an attachment. It returns the HTML content of the analyzed document.

The function ask\_solar() takes a context string and a question as input and sends a POST request to the 'upstage.ai' API endpoint with the context and question as input. It returns the response from the API endpoint.

The function check\_groundedness() takes a context string, a question, and an answer as input and sends a POST request to the 'upstage.ai' API endpoint with the context, question, and answer as input. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the answer is grounded in the context or not.

The script defines another function called chunk\_text() that takes a string and a chunk size as input and returns a list of strings that are chunks of the input string of the specified size.

The script defines a function called process\_html\_content() that takes an HTML content string as input and uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content. It extracts all the paragraph elements from the HTML content and prints their text content.

The script defines a function called read\_file() that takes a file path as input and returns the content of the file.

The script then reads the content of a file called 'TogetherChatCompletions.html' using the read\_file() function and assigns it to a variable called 'context'. It then splits the 'context' into chunks of a specified size.

The script defines a function called chunked\_api\_call() that takes a question as input, calls the ask\_solar() function for each chunk of the 'context', and checks whether the answer is grounded in the context using the check\_groundedness() function. It continues this process until it finds an answer that is grounded in the context.

The script defines another function called api\_call() that takes a context string and a question as input, calls the ask\_solar() function for the entire 'context', and checks whether the answer is grounded in the context using the check\_groundedness() function. It continues this process until it finds an answer that is grounded in the context.

The script defines a variable called user\_prompt that contains a question to be answered by the API.

The script defines two functions called create\_and\_append\_to\_file() and overwrite\_a\_file() that write text to a file called 'generated.py'.

The script defines a function called api\_chain() that calls the chunked\_api\_call() function with the user\_prompt as input, writes the response to the 'generated.py' file, reads the 'generated.py' file, and calls the api\_call() function with the rectified context and a rectification question as input. It writes the response to the 'generated.py' file and prints the response.

The script defines a function called generate\_documentation() that calls the api\_call() function with the 'run.py' file and a documentation question as input, writes the response to a file called 'documentation.txt', and prints the response.

Finally, the script calls the generate\_documentation() function.The `generate_documentation` function is responsible for generating a high-level documentation based on the code in a file called `run.py`. It does this by calling the `api_call` function with the context of the code and the prompt "Can you generate the complete end to end documentation on a high level based on the code in this file. Put everything into a file call documentation.txt". The generated documentation is then printed out and appended to a file called `documentation.txt`.This Python script utilizes the OpenAI's Solar API to perform a series of tasks based on the provided context and user prompts. The script begins by reading the API keys for Document AI and Solar from a configuration file named 'config.cfg'. The script then creates a client object using the Solar API key and base URL.

The script defines several functions to perform various tasks:

1. `analyze_layout(filename)`: This function takes a filename as input, reads the file, sends a POST request to the Document AI layout analyzer API using the provided API key, and returns the HTML content of the analyzed document.

2. `ask_solar(context, question)`: This function takes a context and a question as input, sends a POST request to the Solar chat completions API using the provided model, and returns the response from the API.

3. `check_groundedness(context, question, answer)`: This function takes a context, a question, and an answer as input, sends a POST request to the Solar answer verification API, and returns whether the answer is "grounded" or not.

4. `chunk_text(text, chunk_size)`: This function splits a given text into smaller segments based on the specified chunk size.

5. `process_html_content(html_content)`: This function takes HTML content as input, parses it using BeautifulSoup, and prints the text of all paragraphs in the content.

6. `read_file(file_path)`: This function reads the content of a file specified by the file path and returns the content as a string.

The script then reads the content of a file named 'TogetherChatCompletions.html' and splits it into smaller chunks. It defines two functions, `chunked_api_call(question: str)` and `api_call(context: str, question: str)`, which use the `ask_solar` and `check_groundedness` functions to generate answers to user prompts based on the provided context.

The script then creates a user prompt and calls the `chunked_api_call` function to generate the initial code. The generated code is appended to a file named 'generated.py'. It then creates a rectification question and calls the `api_call` function to refine the generated code. The final code is overwritten in the 'generated.py' file.

Finally, the script defines a function `generate_documentation()` which calls the `api_call` function to generate documentation based on the code in the script. The generated documentation is printed and appended to a file named 'documentation.txt'.The provided Python script is designed to analyze HTML content and make API calls to a chat completion service.

The script will generate the documentation in a file named `documentation.txt`.This code is a Python script that uses various API services to analyze and generate text based on a given context and question. The script is divided into several functions, each performing a specific task. Here is a high-level overview of what the code does:

1. **Configuration:** The script reads the configuration file 'config.cfg' using the ConfigParser module and retrieves the API keys for Document AI (docai\_api\_key) and Solar (solar\_api\_key). It then initializes an OpenAI client using the Solar API key.

2. **Analyzing Document Layout:** The `analyze_layout` function takes a filename as input, sends a POST request to the Document AI layout analyzer API, and returns the HTML content of the analyzed document.

3. **Asking Solar:** The `ask_solar` function sends a POST request to the Solar Chat Completions API with the provided context and question, and returns the generated text answer.

4. **Checking Groundedness:** The `check_groundedness` function sends a POST request to the Solar Chat Completions Answer Verification API with the provided context, question, and answer, and returns whether the answer is "grounded" in the given context.

5. **Chunking Text:** The `chunk_text` function takes a text and a chunk size as input, and returns a list of text chunks with the specified size.

6. **Processing HTML Content:** The `process_html_content` function takes HTML content as input, uses BeautifulSoup to parse the content, and prints the text of all paragraphs (`<p>` tags) in the HTML.

7. **Reading a File:** The `read_file` function takes a file path as input, reads the content of the file, and returns the content as a string.

8. **Chunked API Call:** The `chunked_api_call` function takes a question as input, iterates through the chunked context, asks Solar with each chunk, and checks if the answer is grounded. If a grounded answer is found, it returns the answer.

9. **API Call:** The `api_call` function takes a context and a question as input, asks Solar with the entire context, and checks if the answer is grounded. If a grounded answer is found, it returns the answer.

10. **Generating Code:** The `create_and_append_to_file` and `overwrite_a_file` functions are used to create or append content to a file specified by the `out_file` parameter. The `api_chain` function initiates the process of generating code using `chunked_api_call` and `api_call` functions.

11. **Generating Documentation:** The `generate_documentation` function reads the code in the `run.py` file, sends a prompt to Solar to generate high-level documentation, prints the generated documentation, and appends it to a file named `documentation.txt`.

In summary, this script uses various API services to analyze a document's layout, generate text based on a given context and question, and verify the groundedness of the generated text. It also generates code and documentation based on the context and question provided.
